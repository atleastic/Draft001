    <string name="desc">Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure.
                        He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth —
                        a fate that caused him to be ostracised by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
                        After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village\'s acknowledgement
                        all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through
                        many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by
                        the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world. He soon proved to be one of
                        the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve
                        his dream and become the village\'s Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage,
                        Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</string>
